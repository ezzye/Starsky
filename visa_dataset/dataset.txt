=I am a UK citizen my boyfriend is a US citizen.
=If you come to the UK with a US passport.
You're allowed to stay for 6 months. So if you leave the country before your 6 months... once you enter the UK again does your 6 months restart?.
We planned to fly to Paris or Amsterdam or somewhere really cheap to do this so it extends the stay so we get longer to afford the flight.
